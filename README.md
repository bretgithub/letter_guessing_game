# Letter Guessing Game also known as the Psychic Game

## Description
This was our first homework using JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create a game. The minimum requirements of the game are listed below:
* The app pics a random letter
* The user has to guess which letter by clicking letters on the keyboard (english - US)
* Display specific text on the page 
* Wins
* Losses
* Guesses left
* Guesses made so far
* When the player won, increase wins counter
* When a player lost, increase loses counter
* Display all these results (wins, losses, guesses left, guesses made) to the user

I modified the requirements because I was not interested in displaying losses or wins, you either win and the game reselts or you run out of guesses and the game resets, the counter is set on the guesses left so I met the requirement there and made a more realistic game experience

On top of the requirements and modifications listed above, I added:
* Alerts to let the user know when they won or lost and what the correct letter was
* If the user chose a letter they had already chosen, the user is alerted to picj another letter
* The counter only decreases if the user only pics a unique wrong letter, not a repeat
* The game resets after the user won or lost

The exercise had us manipulate:
* Functions
* Callbacks
* DOM
* Arrays
* Strings
* Debugging

## Roadmap
I intend to redesign this page with more styling using Bootstrap to jazz it up

## Feedback
Open to feedback, I posted pain-points in the comments of the <a href="https://github.com/bretgithub/basic-portfolio/blob/master/assets/css/style.css">style.css</a> file. 

## Shoutout
Props to Molly, Joe, and Trae who are our cohort's TAs who helped work through logic and how to better structure the code in a way that would allow me to write more efficient functions.
